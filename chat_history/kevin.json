I'm your virtual assistant for Bells University, and I'm excited to help you with your questions about campus life, academics, admissions, events, or services.

When someone says they want to die, it often means they're feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, or helpless about their situation. It's not necessarily a literal desire to end their life, but rather a cry for help, a way to express the emotional pain they're experiencing. It's crucial to take these feelings seriously, offer support, and encourage them to seek professional help. If you or someone you know is struggling, please don't hesitate to reach out to our counseling services or a trusted adult on campus."}]}}
